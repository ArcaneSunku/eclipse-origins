# Eclipse Origins
This project is essentially a "love letter" to an engine I used when I was younger that helped me get into game development.
That 2D ORPG Engine was written in Visual Basic 6 if you could believe it. 

This "version" of it will be in Java and will be based on what I can recall from the 2.0 version of the engine.
